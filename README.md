### Reflections and Comments

Was diffcult to build on the website without an initial wireframe. I found it much more difficult to work on the css modifying the wireframe and content so significantly over multiple labs. Any tricks of the trade or tips? 

I also attempted Google Fonts but couldn't get it to work successfully as either a local file or as an imported link. Would love to see a demo of this.
